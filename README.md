# Binary To Decimal Converter

## Description

A application that converts binary numbers into they decimal version, and also the opposite, decimal numbers into binaries. The idea came from a lovely GitHub repository called `app-ideas` and can be found here:

### Difficulty Level

#### 🟢 Beginner

## Requirements

### 🧱 Constraints

* Arrays may **NOT** be used to contain the binary digits entered by the user
* Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in the sequence must be calculated using a single mathematical function, for example the natural logarithm.

### 💼 Mandatory Features

- [x] Users may enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field.
- [x] Users must be notified if anything other than a 0 and 1 was entered.
- [x] Print the result in a single output field containing the decimal number that was entered.

### ⭐ Extra Features

- [x] Add a Decimal to Binary mode that may be accessed with a switch button.
- [ ] Users may add more than a single binary/decimal number at once.


## Final Version

After concluding the project, the last Extra Feature was left over since it requires a complete work around to implement it that it is just not that useful. Since the current stable version looks pleasant and it's properly working, it's time to move on to the next project!
